Pixel Spork is an Arduino library for controlling addressable LEDs. It aims to streamline the use of the popular WS2812 (and other) addressable LEDs by providing a wide variety of rich, class-based, effects and utilities. The library's stand-out feature is "Segment Sets", allowing you to intuitively arrange your LEDs into virtual 1 or 2D shapes. Pixel Spork lets users code at their own comfort level by only requiring a few core tools to operate, but providing many more for power users. Start small with a simple 1D Segment Set and effect, and scale up over time to fully 2D Segment Sets, using multiple effects, while managing multiple palettes, color modes, utilities and more!

Features:

* Over 40 class-based, deeply customizable effects.

* Virtually re-arrange your LEDs into 1D or 2D shapes using Segment Sets.

* Use a suite of utility classes to manage and enhance your effects.

* Add rainbows (or a custom gradients) to most effects using Color Modes.

* Create color palettes to unify colors across you code.

* Compartmentalized design. Most features are optional, meaning that you only need to interact with them if you want to, allowing you to explore and code at your own pace.

* Uses the famous FastLED library as a foundation, ensuring that writing to LEDs is as fast as possible.

* Fully documented, both here and in the code itself. I hate wading through incomplete wikis and unexplained code. I pledge that I will do my very best to keep this wiki complete and up-to-date. If you ever find a topic/feature that isn't explained or is incomplete, please let me know (by opening an issue, etc)!
